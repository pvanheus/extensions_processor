# extensions_processor

Once-off code to load a list of PDFs from a SA government website and extract the relevant data.

Depends on Python 3.7 and a version of `camelot-py` that works with Python 3.7 (current in this pull request: https://github.com/conda-forge/camelot-py-feedstock/pull/11). Other dependencies are listed in `conda_requirements.txt`.

This code should work on MacOS and Linux.
